# Chat BOT Application

This repository contains the code and resources for the Chat BOT application, which includes features for AI-powered queries, CRUD operations, and data visualizations. The application is designed to interact with a student database, enabling advanced querying, real-time database updates, and insightful visualizations.

## Features

### 1. **AI Queries**
The application interprets natural language prompts in English and generates accurate Python or SQL queries along with their results. Examples of supported prompts include:
- **"List students with grades above B in Term 2."**
- **"Who are the top-performing students from low-income families?"**
  (Low-income families are defined as those with an income below â‚¹200,000.)
- **"Which students failed any subject in the last exam?"**

### 2. **CRUD Operations**
- Perform real-time **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** operations on the database.
- View dynamic data changes before and after the operations.

### 3. **Visualizations**
- A bar chart displaying the number of students admitted per year.
- Real-time marks data visualized from the student database.
